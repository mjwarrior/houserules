## Gas Maintenance and Fueling
maintenance considerations

1.	Gas will be provided only for to and from school; any personal outings are under your responsibility for fuel costs. For personal outings not related to schooling or church, fuel usage must be calculated in advance and paid for by you. Maintenance of the vehicle will be done by you unless someone else damages it or puts it in a position where it could be damaged. Insurance for the car is your responsibility.
### Scheduling

1.	Your schedule must be edited and tuned for the day before using the car.
## Revocation requirements 
1.	Failure to follow the rules may result in revocation of vehicle usage privileges.
2.	Vehicle usage privileges may be revoked based on a three-strike system:
  - The first strike will result in the removal of personal outings, such as visiting friends.
  - The second strike will result in the removal of food-related outings.
  - The third strike serves as a final warning.
    Any additional strikes will lead to permanent revocation of vehicle usage. Strikes will be issued if any rule is violated, and they reset monthly.
## Ownership 
1.	Any items in the car that belong to you, and are used, will remain your property. If the vehicle is revoked, any and all items inside the car that are yours must be returned or compensated for accordingly.
