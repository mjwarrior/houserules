# Game/TV/Phone Time

You've stumbled upon my useless home rules. Feel free to add to them if you have ideas.  If we 
adopt your proposed rules, we'll try our best to follow them. If that doesn't work we'll remove them.

### Basics
The basics enable many things. Read below.
    
    - House must be clean
    - Homework must be done
    - Clothing Must be ready for next day
    - Every Week starts with 4 hours time for each child
### Earning
These actions can earn you extra weekend time
    
    - Get dad up such that he is working out by 4:30 (+30 Mins)
    - Exercising on the treadmill for at least 1 hour to earn (+30 Mins)
    - Mowing the back or front part of the lawn and trimming it earns you (+1 hour)
    - *more to come if you have ideas*
### Losing
These actions can waste your extra weekend time
    
    - Watch TV or Play Games or be on phone when `Basics` not complete (-30 Mins)
    - Dad get’s you up after 8AM (-30 Mins)
    - Losing 180 Min in a week - equates to all weekend time lost regardless of time earned
### Usage
Using time is a time honored passed time.

    - Gametime/TV-time may be used only during the weekend
    - Each child allotted 2 hour Gametime/TV-time per weekday (non-transferable)
    - Unused weekday gametime allotment is lost after 8pm
