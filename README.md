# Game/TV/Phone Time

You've stumbled upon my useless home rules. Feel free to add to them if you have ideas.  If we 
adopt your proposed rules, we'll try our best to follow them. If that doesn't work we'll remove them.

**game time references apply to Game/TV/Phone time**

### Basics
The basics enable many things. Read below.
    
    - House must be clean
    - Homework must be done
    - Clothing must be ready for next day
    - Playing on school days before dad is awake, after 8am, before 4pm, or after 8pm is prohibited
    - Every week starts with 4 hours allotted weekend game time for each child

### Earning
These actions can earn you extra weekend time
    
    - Get dad up such that he is working out by 4:30am (+30 Mins ea/day, or +1 hour ea/day if done for Mon-Sat)
    - *more to come if you have ideas*

### Losing
These actions can waste your extra weekend time
    
    - Watch TV or Play Games  or be on phone when `Basics` not complete (-30 Mins)
    - Dad get’s you up after 8AM (-30 Mins)
    - Losing 180 Min in a week - equates to all weekend time lost regardless of time earned
    - Group offenders lose all weekend time

### Usage
Using time is a time honored passed time.

    - Earned weekend game timemay be used on Saturday from 6am until 8pm (ie. max usable earned game time is 14 hours)
    - Each child allotted 2 hour game time per week day (non-transferable)
    - Daily allotted game time used before 8am does not take from the daily allotted
    - Unused daily weekday game time allotment is lost after 8pm
    - Rules are not retro-active (can't enforce a rule until it's written)
    - Weekend gametime starts at 6am Saturday and counts down from that point (eg. 3 hours earned game time expires at 9am)
